# Melbourne House Sales Transaction with Airflow
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report based on a dataset containing home sales in Melbourne, Australia, during the period from 2016 to 2017. This report will include:

- Data cleaning and validation using Great Expectations to ensure data quality and completeness.
- Exploratory analysis to understand housing price trends, sales distribution by location, property size, and other relevant variables.
- Identification of factors that influence house prices, such as location, property type, number of rooms, and proximity to public amenities.
- Strategic recommendations for the management or property sales team based on the findings from the exploratory analysis.
- Implementing a scheduling process using Apache Airflow to automate and manage the execution of the entire pipeline, from data extraction and validation to EDA and report generation, ensuring that the tasks are completed consistently and on time.

With this report and the use of Airflow for scheduling, the team is expected to gain better insights into the real estate market conditions in Melbourne during the period and use the analysis results to support strategic decision-making, as well as plan more effective marketing strategies in response to property market fluctuations.
